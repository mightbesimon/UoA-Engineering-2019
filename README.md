# UoA Engineering ENGGEN 131

**Semester 2 2019**

these are just my sample codes, if you misuse them its *not my problem*\
some of these do not work for the labs anymore bc i played around with them so much\
but i cbf going back and fixing them

### Resources Included

- MATLAB labs
- MATLAB project 2019
- C labs
- C project 2019

### Prerequisites

You will need to install
* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/) - for MATLAB in weeks 1-6
* GCC - for compiling C in weeks 7-12\
on mac:
```
$ gcc
```

to check if already installed, do:
```
$ gcc --version
```

### Compiling

You will need to compile .c source files\
on mac:
```
gcc -o binaryFile sourceFile.c
./binaryFile
```


although you do not need to compile for matlab\
if you want to avoid matlab's cancerous IDE and have a python-like experience\
there is a way to run scripts in terminal without lauching matlab\
using this command `/Applications/MATLAB_R2019a.app/bin/matlab -nodesktop -nosplash`

alternatively, save an alias using this command:
```
$ echo "alias matlab='/Applications/MATLAB_R2019a.app/bin/matlab -nodesktop -nosplash'" >> .bash_profile
```
note the version number will differ\
and then launch simply using:
```
$ matlab
```
this way you can use matlab in terminal (like python) instead of the pretty cancerous IDE
